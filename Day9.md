## Digital Safe System
`Code`
```verilog
`timescale 1ns / 1ps
module Digital_Safe_System(
input [0:3]p,
output I);
wire [0:3]s;
assign s= 4'b1011;      //predefined password
xnor G1(w1,s[0],p[0]);
xnor G2(w2,s[1],p[1]);
xnor G3(w3,s[2],p[2]);
xnor G4(w4,s[3],p[3]);
and G5(I,w1,w2,w3,w4);
endmodule
```
`Testbench`
```verilog

## Mini-Project: Car Parking Occupied Slot Counting system
Our last real-life problem is as follows. There is a car park with three slots and we would like to know how many of its slots are occupied at a given time. Within the design, occupied slot locations are not important. We can design a combinational circuit for this purpose. Assume that we placed a sensor over each slot which gives output logic level 1 when the slot is occupied. If the slot is empty, sensor gives output logic level 0. Letâ€™s label output of sensors as binary variables s0, s1, and s2. The designed combinational circuit will provide the output as a two-bit binary number c1 (MSB) and c0 (LSB). Therefore, we should cover all input combinations in terms of a truth table.

`Code`
```verilog
`timescale 1ns / 1ps
module car_park(
    input [2:0] s,
    output [1:0] c
    );
    assign c[1]=(s[0]&s[1])||(s[0]&s[2])||(s[1]&s[2]);
    assign c[0]=s[0]^s[1]^s[2];
endmodule
```
`TestBench`
```verilog
`timescale 1ns / 1ps
module car_park_tb();
reg [2:0]s;
wire [1:0]c;
car_park uut(s,c);
initial
begin
s=3'd0;
#10 s=3'd1;
#10 s=3'd2;
#10 s=3'd3;
#10 s=3'd4;
#10 s=3'd5;
#10 s=3'd6;
#10 s=3'd7;
#10 $finish;
end
endmodule
```
